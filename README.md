   In the Coolify environment variables section, add:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com/api
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. **Configure Build Context**
   - **Root Directory**: `asset-management-game-dev-FE`
   - **Dockerfile**: (Leave empty to use Coolify's auto-detection)
   - **Build Context**: `asset-management-game-dev-FE`

6. **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**
   If you need custom Docker configuration, create a `Dockerfile` in the frontend directory:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine AS base
   
   # Install dependencies only when needed
   FROM base AS deps
   RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
   COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
   RUN corepack enable pnpm && pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
   
   # Rebuild the source code only when needed
   FROM base AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY . .
   
   # Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
   ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
   
   RUN corepack enable pnpm && pnpm build
   
   # Production image, copy all the files and run next
   FROM base AS runner
   WORKDIR /app
   
   ENV NODE_ENV production
   ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
   
   RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
   RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
   
   COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
   
   # Set the correct permission for prerender cache
   RUN mkdir .next
   RUN chown nextjs:nodejs .next
   
   # Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static
   
   USER nextjs
   
   EXPOSE 3000
   
   ENV PORT 3000
   ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"
   
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

7. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy" in Coolify
   - Monitor the build logs for any issues
   - Once deployed, your app will be available at the provided URL

#### Custom Domain Setup
1. In Coolify, go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Add your custom domain (e.g., `assettrackr.yourdomain.com`)
4. Configure DNS records as instructed by Coolify
5. Enable SSL certificate (Coolify handles this automatically with Let's Encrypt)

#### Environment-Specific Configuration

**Development Environment:**
```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

**Production Environment:**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
```

#### Monitoring & Logs
- **Build Logs**: Available in Coolify dashboard during deployment
- **Runtime Logs**: Accessible in the "Logs" tab of your project
- **Health Checks**: Coolify automatically monitors your application health

#### Troubleshooting Coolify Deployment

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build Fails with "pnpm not found"**
   - Ensure Node.js version is 18+ in Coolify settings
   - Add `corepack enable pnpm` to build command

2. **Port Issues**
   - Make sure your app listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`
   - Check that `PORT` environment variable is set

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Increase memory limit in Coolify project settings
   - Consider using `--max-old-space-size=4096` in build command

4. **Static File Issues**
   - Ensure `next.config.mjs` has `images: { unoptimized: true }` for static hosting
   - Check that all static assets are in the `public` directory

#### Scaling with Coolify
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Coolify's scaling features to run multiple instances
- **Load Balancing**: Coolify automatically handles load balancing
- **Resource Limits**: Set CPU and memory limits in project settings

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Other Platforms
The app can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js:
- **Netlify** - Static export or serverless functions
- **Railway** - Full-stack deployment
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment

## 🧪 Development

### Mock Data
The app includes comprehensive mock data for development:
- **Projects** - Sample game projects with realistic data
- **Asset Groups** - Hierarchical organization with sub-assets
- **Upload Jobs** - Simulated upload processing with status tracking
- **Users** - Team member data for assignee management
- **Rule Packs** - Complete validation rules for all asset types

### API Fallbacks
The API client automatically falls back to mock data when the backend is unavailable, making development seamless. This allows the frontend to be developed and tested independently.

### Current Limitations
- **No Real Authentication** - Sign-in button is mock only
- **No File Upload Processing** - Files are validated client-side only
- **No Path Template Resolution** - Templates are stored but not previewed
- **No Backend Integration** - All data comes from mock sources

## 🚀 Next Development Steps

### Priority 1: Authentication
1. **GitHub OAuth Setup**
   - Create GitHub OAuth app
   - Add API route: `app/api/auth/github/route.ts`
   - Implement callback handling
   - Add session management

### Priority 2: File Upload Integration
1. **Target-Locked Uploads**
   - Wire upload buttons to FileUpload component
   - Add sub-asset selection in upload flow
   - Implement path template resolution

2. **Server-Side Validation**
   - Add file validation API endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add progress tracking

### Priority 3: Path Template System
1. **Live Path Preview**
   - Create PathPreview component
   - Add template resolution logic
   - Integrate with SubAssetDrawer

### Priority 4: Backend Integration
1. **Replace Mock Data**
   - Connect to real API endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states

### Testing
```bash
# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Run type checking
pnpm type-check

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Styling Not Loading
If the app appears unstyled or with overlapping elements:
1. Ensure you're using the correct Tailwind CSS version (v3.4.0+)
2. Check that `postcss.config.mjs` is properly configured
3. Verify `tailwind.config.ts` exists and is properly set up
4. Restart the development server: `pnpm dev`

#### Inline Editing Issues
If clicking on editable fields opens the asset drawer:
1. This has been fixed in the latest version
2. Ensure you're using the updated `inline-edit.tsx` component
3. The fix includes proper event propagation handling

#### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors:
1. Clear the Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
3. Check for TypeScript errors: `pnpm type-check`
